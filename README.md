## Transaction Statistics
This is a RESTful API to hold transactions and provide realtime statistics for the last 60 seconds.

## API endpoints

#### POST /transactions

This endpoint is called to create a new transaction.

Request:

    {
      "amount": "12.3343",
      "timestamp": "2018-07-17T09:59:51.312Z"
    }
Where:

amount – transaction amount; a string of arbitrary length that is parsable as a BigDecimal
timestamp – transaction time in the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ in the UTC timezone (this is not the current timestamp)
 

Returns: Empty body with one of the following:

    201 – in case of success
    204 – if the transaction is older than 60 seconds
    400 – if the JSON is invalid
    422 – if any of the fields are not parsable or the transaction date is in the future
 

#### GET /statistics

This endpoint returns the statistics based on the transactions that happened in the last 60 seconds. It executes in constant time and memory (O(1)).

Response:

    {
      "sum": "1000.00",
      "avg": "100.53",
      "max": "200000.49",
      "min": "50.23",
      "count": 10
    }

Where:

sum – a BigDecimal specifying the total sum of transaction value in the last 60 seconds

avg – a BigDecimal specifying the average amount of transaction value in the last 60 seconds

max – a BigDecimal specifying single highest transaction value in the last 60 seconds

min – a BigDecimal specifying single lowest transaction value in the last 60 seconds

count – a long specifying the total number of transactions that happened in the last 60 seconds

All BigDecimal values always contain exactly two decimal places and use `HALF_ROUND_UP` rounding. eg: 10.345 is returned as 10.35 10.8 is returned as 10.80

 

#### DELETE /transactions

This endpoint causes all existing transactions to be deleted

The endpoint should accept an empty request body and return a 204 status code. 


### Build Instructions

This API runs using `REDIS` storage, so you'll need to have a [redis server](https://redis.io/) running. To install redis, simply run `sudo apt-ge install redis` on a **linux** or **wsl** terminal.

#### Install Packages
```bash
npm i
```

#### Run redis Server
on a seprate `linux` or `wsl` terminal, startup the redis server
```bash
redis-server
```

#### Run nodejs server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application listens on port 3000 by default.
